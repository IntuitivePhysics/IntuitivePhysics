            <p>Physics is more than a bunch of mathematical equations. It describes the beautiful and simplistic laws of
                nature (can we all just forget about quantum mechanics for a moment)! Yet, a standard physics education
                often omits these subtleties. Therefore, in Intuitive Physics, I wish to share with you some fascinating
                yet
                omitted insights into classical physics.</p>
