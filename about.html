            Physics can be hard for many, especially when it looks like just a bunch of equations jumbled together.

            When I studied physics, I was constantly puzzled by various concepts. Why is Ohm's Law true? How exactly
            does a voltage drop form across a resistor? Why can magnetic field have energy while it cannot do work? Why
            is work defined as $F\cdot dl$? Why is impulse defined as $F dt$? Why is momentum the velocity derivative of
            kinetic energy? Why does time dilates and length contracts? ...
        </p>

            The intent of this blog is to provide some useful insights into these confusing topics of introductory physics that may be glossed over in textbooks. Physics is beautiful!
