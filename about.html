            Philosophy of Intuitive Physics
        </h2>
        <p>
            Physics can be hard for many, especially when it looks like just a bunch of equations jumbled together.
        </p>
        <p>
            A standard high school and even undergraduate physics education often focuses on the engineering aspect of
            physics. It teaches students the equations of physics and how to apply them, while glossing over the
            <b>physics</b> behind the math.
        </p>
        <p>
            Standard introductory physics textbooks fall short of elucidating why each equation makes sense, why it
            takes on its particular form, and how it connects with other equations.

            Personal Experience

            Of course, above are just my grudges towards high school physics education.

            When I studied physics, I was constantly puzzled by various concepts. Why is Ohm's Law true? How exactly
            does a voltage drop form across a resistor? Why can magnetic field have energy while it cannot do work? Why
            is work defined as $F\cdot dl$? Why is impulse defined as $F dt$? Why is momentum the velocity derivative of
            kinetic energy? ...
        </p>
        <p>
            I usually couldn't find answer from textbooks. Many questions even teachers couldn't answer. So I searched
            online; I looked through <a href="https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu" target="_blank">Feynman's Lecture Notes</a>; I
            searched through different textbooks; I pondered for hours and built simulations. So far, I've answered
            almost every question I asked myself. But it took ages!

            The intent of this blog is to share some of my "findings," so other curious physics students don't have to waste
            hours researching similar questions.
